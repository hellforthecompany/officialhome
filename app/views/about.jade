					Born and raised in slow paced Santa Cruz, CA, Adam 
					spent all his teenage years playing guitar and obsessing
					over rock records. In his short lived student careers at 
					Cal State University Monterey Bay he met Tyler Dinner where 
					they formed a band. Known as Andorra and even Mary's Rebellion
					for a little, the band would prove to be the foundation for Hell for 
					the Company, as well as cement Adam and Tyler as a permanent 
					musical team.

					From the rough and real Hell's Kitchen in the 90's comes Max 
					Pena. Growing up with tons of energy, a lack of physical space, and
					a handful of inherited instruments, Max honed his frustrations into 
					licks and riffs. Max became friends with Tyler Dinner shortly after the two met in 
					the Borough of Manhattan Community College's weekly music club. The next year, after a 
					few months without contact, the two randomly passed each other on the street in 
					Park Slope, Brooklyn, where Tyler had just moved. Max, Tyler and Tyler's brother
					Michael began playing music frequently, and, within a few months, Hell for 
					the Company was born.

				h2 Michael Dinner
				h3 Guitar, Vocals, Keys, Bass, Engineer
				p.
					Born and raised in small town Monterey, CA, Michael enjoyed music at 
					a young age before becoming obssessed with guitar and all things that rock
					in his mid teens. With a musical family lineage, razor sharp focus and 
					more drive than 2 people can normally exert, Michael has spent the last decade
					honing his chops and his writing skills to include songs that range from stories
					of Vigilante Superheroes to crazy encounters with law enforcement.
					The younger of 2, he moved to New York City with his brother to puruse music, and
					so far he hasn't looked back.

				p.
					Hailing from Monterey, CA, Tyler quickly turned a song-writing hobby into
					a musical obsession which eventually drove him to quit college baseball in order 
					to pursue the art full time. After trying to get bands together in California, 
					Tyler moved to New York City in 2008 and teamed up with his brother to make 
					music their main focus. After a few more band attempts, Tyler and his brother Michael
					eventually teamed up with Max Pena and founded Hell for the Company in 2010.
